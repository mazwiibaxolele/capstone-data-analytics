# capstone-data-analytics
This capstone project explores emerging and in-demand technology skills using data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and other relevant sources. Acting as an Associate Data Analyst in a technology consulting environment, the project focuses on identifying trends in programming languages, databases, platforms, frameworks, and development tools.

The project follows a complete data analytics lifecycle, including data collection through APIs and web scraping, data wrangling to address missing values and inconsistencies, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization. Statistical and visual techniques are applied to uncover patterns, correlations, and shifts in technology preferences among developers worldwide.

Insights are presented through interactive dashboards created in IBM Cognos Analytics or Google Looker Studio, supported by clear visual storytelling and minimal, professional design principles. The final results are summarized in a structured presentation aimed at supporting strategic decision-making for organizations seeking to understand future skill requirements in the technology industry.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data analytics, visualization, and communication while reflecting a modern, academic, and business-focused analytical approach.
